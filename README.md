## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating Employee-Manager was to create an application that manages employee information by departments, roles, and employees within my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to allow a quick edit and view of the relevant employee information associated to my business thus allowing me to organize and plan more efficiently.

By creating this app, I learned the following: mySql.
